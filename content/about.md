Hey folks. My name is Blair Fix. I'm a political economist based in Toronto. My main blog is over at [Economics from the Top Down](https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/), a place where I share my research on things like income inequality, hierarchy, energy and capital as power.

Here you will find musings on my daily work as a scientist, including my days spent writing R code, as well as other sciency things I do on my computer.
