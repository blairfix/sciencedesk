The Swisher effect is the tendency for wage growth to rise and fall with the rate of inflation. It was discovered in 1909 by the economist [Donald Swisher](https://sciencedesk.economicsfromthetopdown.com/satire/swisher/).

Swisher used this effect to propose that in a competitive market, wages gravitate towards a 'natural rate' which preserves the income-earning capacity of labor power.

Decades later, Swisher's student [Milton Fryman](https://sciencedesk.economicsfromthetopdown.com/satire/fryman/) built on the Swisher effect to argue that wage growth was a key tool for regulating inflation.
